The terrarium created via CSS was inspired by Jakub Mandra's glass jar [codepen](https://codepen.io/Rotarepmi/pen/rjpNZY).

The artwork was hand drawn by [Jen Looper](http://jenlooper.com) using Procreate.

The solution to draggable elements was inspired by w3schools solution on creating a [Draggable HTML Element](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_draggable.asp).
